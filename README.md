#  Rent Calculator Python Mini Project

This is a beginner-level Python project to calculate the rent each person needs to pay in a shared flat or hostel. The program takes into account the **total rent**, **food expenses**, and **electricity charges** and splits the cost equally among all roommates.

##  Project Objective

To create a simple utility that helps roommates or flatmates divide total monthly expenses fairly using basic Python code and input/output functions.

##  Inputs Required

The user is asked to enter the following details:

1. Rent of the hostel/flat  
2. Amount spent on food/snacks  
3. Total electricity usage (in units)  
4. Charge per electricity unit  
5. Number of people sharing the flat  

##  Output

- The program calculates and prints how much **each person** should pay based on the total cost.

##  How It Works

Here’s a quick overview of what the script does:

1. Takes user inputs for rent, food, electricity units, rate per unit, and number of people.
2. Calculates the **electricity bill** using:  3. Adds up **food + rent + electricity bill**.
   (total_bill = electricity_units * rate_per_unit)
3. Adds up **food + rent + electricity bill**.
4. Divides the total by the number of people to find out each person's share.
5. Prints the result.

## Example

**Input:**
Rent = ₹4000, 
Food = ₹3000,
Electricity Units = 100,
Rate per Unit = ₹10,
People = 3

**Output:**

Each person will pay = ₹2666
